      <h2>About the Program</h2>
      <p>This program simply involves using a sequncable collection to insert elements from either the front or the back, and showing how that
        collection expands overtime as you add more elements to it.
      </p>
      <p>Context: I made this for a class project in CS 474 (Object Oriented Implementation). To be honest, it is not super interesting to me, but at least I learned how to create a sequencable collection in C++ and how to shift the elements in it with ease. :|</p>

      <p>You may notice in some of the bullet points it says "Not utilized in final program". By that, it means it was not included in the main script: see, some requirements were added last minute in the prompt my professor gave us, so I did not have time to implement them.</p>
