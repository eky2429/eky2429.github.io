  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>About the Program</h2>
      <p>This program simply involves using a sequncable collection to insert elements from either the front or the back, and showing how that
        collection expands overtime as you add more elements to it.
      </p>
      <p>Context: I made this for a class project in CS 474 (Object Oriented Implementation). To be honest, it is not super interesting to me, but at least I learned how to create a sequencable collection in C++ and how to shift the elements in it with ease. :|</p>

      <p>Just saying for this class, I am REQUIRED to use AI to assist in my code. I just simply used ChatGPT and CoPilot to help provide some clarification for the prompt because there were some parts that seemed vague (like adding the element at index 3 and then either 2 or 4 afterward...) and for creating test cases (because I forgot how to do that in C++ 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️).</p>

      <p>You may notice in some of the bullet points it says "Not utilized in final program". By that, it means it was not included in the main script: see, some requirements were added last minute in the prompt my professor gave us, so I did not have time to implement them.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Added way to insert elements from either the front or the back of the collection</li>
        <li>Added way to display the current elements in the collection</li>
        <li>Added way to show how the collection expands as more elements are added</li>
        <li>Added way to remove elements from either the front or the back of the collection (NOT used in final program)</li>
        <li>Added way to insert elements based on index value (NOT used in final program)</li>
      </ul>
