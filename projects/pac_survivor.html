      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <p>Pac Survivor is an exciting game that combines classic Pac-Man elements with survival mechanics.</p>
      <p>Context: This game was originally made as a class project (Pacman Battle Royale 99; see the projects page). But I decided to remake it <a href="https://genius.com/Meghan-trainor-all-about-that-bass-lyrics">"from the bottom to the top" - Megan Trainor</a>. The orignal version did not have the best coding practices, like lines of cod for UI used in pac man or vice versa. Also, we did not focus too much on sound design (and I am usually a stickler for it), so I revamped the audio experience to make it more immersive. This is what to expect from the final version!</p>

      <h2>Development Status</h2>
      <p>Right now, I am working on implementing the unique features that my group members added to the original version: unique ghost behaviors (going through walls, shooting bullets, orbiting fireball, etc.), a way to save your score(s), powerups (speed, sprint, shooting stun bullets, magnet, pushback, etc.), a shop scene for upgrading pacman.</p>
