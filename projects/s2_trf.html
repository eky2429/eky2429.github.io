      <h2>About the Project</h2>

      <p>I was actually inspired to create this game since the original game developer, Fedriz, was going to release it in 2014, but cancelled since he wanted to focus on creating other indie games. So, I messaged him, myself, for permission to use his assets to make the game, and low and behold, I was given permission to do so. I look forward to providing more details about this game and providing more in the long-run!</p>

      <h2>What software / languages am I using for this project?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Godot Engine</li>
        <li>GDScript</li>
      </ul>
